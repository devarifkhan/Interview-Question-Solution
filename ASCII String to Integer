Easy

You are given a string s containing digits from "0" to "9" and lowercase alphabet characters. Return the sum of the numbers found in s.

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of s
Example 1
Input
s = "11aa32bbb5"
Output
48
Explanation
Since 11 + 32 + 5 = 48.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        onlyNumber=re.findall('[0-9]+',s)
        if onlyNumber==[]:
            return 0
        else:
            return sum([int(i) for i in onlyNumber])
