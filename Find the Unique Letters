Create a function that takes a string and returns the letters that occur only once.
Examples

find_letters("monopoly") ➞ ["m", "n", "p", "l", "y"]

find_letters("balloon") ➞ ["b", "a", "n"]

find_letters("analysis") ➞ ["n", "l", "y", "i"]

Notes

    The final list should not include letters that appear more than once in the string.
    Return the letters in the sequence they were originally in, do not sort them.
    All letters will be in lowercase.
    
    
Solution:

def find_letters(word):
	List = []
	for i in word:
		if word.count(i) == 1:
			List.append(i)
	return List
