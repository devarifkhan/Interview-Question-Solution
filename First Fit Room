You are given a list of integers rooms and an integer target. Return the first integer in rooms that's target or larger. If there is no solution, return -1.

Constraints

0 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of rooms
Example 1
Input
rooms = [15, 10, 30, 50, 25]
target = 20
Output
30
Explanation
30 is the first room that's at least as large as 20.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, rooms, target):
        result=0
        for i in rooms:
            if i==target:
                result=i
                break
            elif i>=target:
                result=i
                break
            else:
                result=-1
        return result
