You are given a list of integers nums. Return whether the list alternates from first strictly increasing to strictly decreasing and then strictly increasing etc. If a list is only strictly increasing, return true.

Constraints

2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [1, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 8, 3, 2]
Output
True
Explanation
This list strictly increases, strictly decreases, strictly increases, then strictly decreases.


Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        return nums[0]<=nums[1] and all([nums[i-1]!=nums[i] for i in range(1,len(nums))])
